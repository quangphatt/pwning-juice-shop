= Running OWASP Juice Shop

include::../attributes.adoc[]

== System requirements

To run a single instance of Juice Shop the following memory and CPU
requirements apply. These resources are needed for the Juice Shop
application process itself, and they are based on

* a 30-day average
process CPU and RAM usage of the official public demo instance running `v14.0.1` of Juice Shop
* a training with ~30 participants on a xref:part4/trainers.adoc#_hosting_individual_instances_for_multiple_users[MultiJuicer] cluster hosted on OpenShift with Juice Shop `v14.0.1`

Please note that any additional resources needed by your environment (e.g. Docker or Vagrant) come on top.

* *Minimum* system specification
 ** `256 MB` RAM
 ** `200 millicpu` CPU
 ** `300 MB` free disk space
* *Recommended* system specification
 ** `384 MB` RAM
 ** `400 millicpu` CPU
 ** `800 MB` free disk space

üóÑÔ∏è _If installing <<_from_sources,from sources>> without the `--depth 1` option, an additional `700
MB` free disk space are required for the Git history in both minimum and
recommended spec._

== Run options

In the following sections you find step-by-step instructions to deploy a
running instance of OWASP Juice Shop for your personal hacking
endeavours.

=== Local installation

To run the Juice Shop locally you need to have
http://nodejs.org/[Node.js] installed on your computer. The Juice Shop
officially runs on versions {nodeVersions} of Node.js, closely
following the official
https://github.com/nodejs/LTS[Node.js Long-term Support Release Schedule].
During development and Continuous Integration (CI) the application is
automatically tested with these current versions of Node.js. The
officially recommended version to run Juice Shop is either the most
recent _Long-term Support (LTS)_ version or the _Current Release_
version. Therefore Juice Shop recommends Node.js
{recommendedNodeVersion} for its own {juiceShopVersion}
release.

==== From sources

. Install http://nodejs.org/[Node.js] on your computer.
. On the command line run `+git clone
https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop.git --depth 1+`.
. Go into the cloned folder with `cd juice-shop`
. Run `npm install`. This only has to be done before the first start or
after you changed the source code.
. Run `npm start` to launch the application.
. Browse to http://localhost:3000

==== From pre-packaged distribution

. Install a 64bit http://nodejs.org/[Node.js] on your Windows, MacOS
or Linux machine.
. Download `juice-shop-<version>_<node-version>_<os>_x64.zip` (or
`.tgz`) attached to the
https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/releases/latest[latest release on GitHub].
. Unpack the archive and run `npm start` in unpacked folder to launch
the application
. Browse to http://localhost:3000

=== Docker image

You need to have https://www.docker.com/[Docker] installed to run
Juice Shop as a container inside it. Following the instructions below
will download the current stable version (built from `master` branch on
GitHub) which internally runs the application on the currently
recommended Node.js version {recommendedNodeVersion}.

. Install https://www.docker.com/[Docker] on your computer.
. On the command line run `docker pull bkimminich/juice-shop` to
download the `latest` image described above.
. Run `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop` to launch the
container with that image.
. Browse to http://localhost:3000.

If you are using Docker on Windows - inside a VirtualBox VM - make sure
that you also enable port forwarding from host `127.0.0.1:3000` to
`0.0.0.0:3000` for TCP.

==== Supported architectures

The official Docker image is built automatically during CI/CD for
`linux/amd64` (based on a Node.js {recommendedNodeVersion} image) as well as `linux/arm64` and `linux/arm/v7` (based on a Node.js 14 image) and both are pushed to DockerHub. The following tagged images are available on DockerHub:

* Stable version from `master` branch: `latest` for AMD/ARM64 and `latest-arm` for ARMv7
* Development version from `develop` branch: `snapshot` for AMD/ARM64 and `snapshot-arm` for ARMv7
* Tagged versioned releases: `vX.Y.Z` for AMD/ARM64 and `vX.Y.Z-arm` for ARMv7

=== Vagrant

Vagrant is an open-source solution for building and maintaining virtual
software development environments. It creates a Virtualbox VM that will
launch a Docker container instance of the `latest` Juice Shop image
{juiceShopVersion}.

. Install https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html[Vagrant] and
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[Virtualbox]
. Run `+git clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop.git+` (or
clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/fork[your own fork]
of the repository)
. Run `cd vagrant && vagrant up`
. Browse to http://192.168.56.110

== Installing a specific release version

The installation instructions above will all give you the latest
official release version of the Juice Shop. If you want to install a
specific older version, you can easily do so by retrieving the
corresponding tag from GitHub or Docker. For release v7.5.1 - which was
the last version with the original AngularJS/Bootstrap frontend - for
example:

* <<_from_sources,From sources>> - Run `git fetch --tags` and then `git
checkout v7.5.1` before running `npm install`
* <<_docker_image,Docker image>> - Run `docker pull
bkimminich/juice-shop:v7.5.1` instead of the usual `docker pull
bkimminich/juice-shop`
* <<_from_pre_packaged_distribution,From pre-packaged distribution>> -
Just download the older release from
https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/releases or
https://sourceforge.net/projects/juice-shop/files/

To experience a preview of the next upcoming Juice Shop version you can
do as follows:

* Simply visit https://juice-shop-staging.herokuapp.com and take a
look
* <<_from_sources,From sources>> - Run `git fetch` and then `git checkout
develop` before running `npm install`
* <<_docker_image,Docker image>> - Run `docker pull
bkimminich/juice-shop:snapshot` instead of the usual `docker pull
bkimminich/juice-shop`

‚ÑπÔ∏è Please be aware that support by the core team or community is
limited (at best) for outdated and unreleased versions alike. To fully
enjoy your OWASP Juice Shop experience, it is recommended to always use
the latest version.

== _Self-healing_-feature

OWASP Juice Shop was not exactly designed and built with a high
availability and reactive enterprise-scale architecture in mind. It runs
perfectly fine and fast when it is attacked via a browser by a human.
When under attack by an automated tool - especially aggressive brute
force scripts - the server might crash under the load. This could - in
theory - leave the database and file system in an unpredictable state
that prevents a restart of the application.

That is why - in practice - Juice Shop wipes the entire database and the
folder users might have modified during hacking. After performing this
_self-healing_ the application is supposed to be restartable, no matter
what kind of problem originally caused it to crash. For convenience the
_self-healing_ happens during the start-up (i.e. `npm start`) of the
server, so no extra command needs to be issued to trigger it.

== Single-user restriction

There is one fundamental restriction that needs to be taken into account
when working with the OWASP Juice Shop, especially in group trainings or
lectures:

*A server instance of OWASP Juice Shop is supposed to be used by only a
single-user!*

This restriction applies to all the <<_run_options,Run Options>>
explained above. It is technically necessary to make the
<<_self_healing_feature,_Self-healing_-feature>> work properly and
consistently. Furthermore, when multiple users would attack the same
instance of the Juice Shop all their progress tracking would be mixed
leading to inevitable confusion for the individual hacker. The upcoming
xref:part1/challenges.adoc#_challenge_tracking[Challenge tracking] chapter will illustrate this topic.

It should not go unmentioned that it is of course okay to have multiple
users hack the same instance from a shared machine in a kind of
_pair-hacking_-style.

If you want to centrally host Juice Shop instances for multiple users
you find more information in section
xref:part4/trainers.adoc#_hosting_individual_instances_for_multiple_users[Hosting individual instances for multiple users]
of the trainer's guide.
